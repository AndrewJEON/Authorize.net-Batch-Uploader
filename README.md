Authorize.net-Batch-Uploader
============================

C# module using http requests to upload a batch file for authorize.net something that the official SDK does not support.

It piggy backs off the official authorize.net API and my code is nestled inside of ../Authorize.NET/staunch/

Full readme coming soon.
